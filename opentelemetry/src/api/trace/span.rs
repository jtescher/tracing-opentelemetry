// A `Span` represents a single operation within a trace. `Span`s can be nested to form a trace
// tree. Each trace contains a root span, which typically describes the end-to-end latency and,
// optionally, one or more sub-spans for its sub-operations.
//
// The `Span`'s start and end timestamps reflect the elapsed real time of the operation. A `Span`'s
// start time SHOULD be set to the current time on span creation. After the `Span` is created, it
// SHOULD be possible to change its name, set its `Attributes`, and add `Links` and `Events`.
// These MUST NOT be changed after the `Span`'s end time has been set.
//
// `Spans` are not meant to be used to propagate information within a process. To prevent misuse,
// implementations SHOULD NOT provide access to a `Span`'s attributes besides its `SpanContext`.
//
// Vendors may implement the `Span` interface to effect vendor-specific logic. However, alternative
// implementations MUST NOT allow callers to create Spans directly. All `Span`s MUST be created
// via a Tracer.

    // case when a `Span` is definitely not recorded. Note that any child span's recording is

    // of this scenario may be recording and processing of all incoming requests for the processing
    // and building of SLA/SLO latency charts while sending only a subset - sampled spans - to the
    // backend. See also the sampling section of SDK design.
